# Recipe App 

## Version 1.0 notes:

The idea behind this project is to learn file read write functions and learn to use API to generate content. This app:

1. Takes in a category from the user
2. Searches that category on the API provided by Edamam
3. Extracts name, number of ingredient required and instruction URL of 10 recipes
4. Writes the name, number and ingredient in three different files. These three files act as a database for further activities
5. Once the database is updated, the program prompts the user to either check the list of the recipe, or generate a random recipe
6. Based on user prompt, the program accesses the database (text files), extracts the information and returns the result
